# DATT3300_mirrored_balls

Hey guys, this is our GIT. Right now, the only scene is the test scene - this is just where I've been playing around with the code and stuff.

To create a level at the moment:
The buttons need to be connected to specific platforms in the Unity Editor - drag the platform from the Hierarchy to the "Platforms" field for each button.
I am working on connecting buttons to multiple platforms but for now that doesn't exist. If there's any code questions, let me know!
